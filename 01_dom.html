DOM:
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that allows web developers to interact with and manipulate HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a hierarchical tree of objects, enabling developers to dynamically modify the content, style, and structure of a webpage using programming languages like JavaScript.

Here are the key aspects of the DOM:

1. Representation of the Web Page
    When a web page is loaded into a browser, the browser creates a DOM tree representing the HTML document.
    Each part of the HTML (elements, attributes, text) becomes a node in the DOM tree.


Example:
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>

html
  └── body
       ├── h1
       │     └── Text: "Hello, World!"
       └── p
             └── Text: "This is a paragraph."



2. Manipulation
JavaScript can be used to:

Select Elements: Find elements in the DOM tree using methods like getElementById, querySelector, or getElementsByClassName.
Change Content: Update the text or HTML inside an element.
Change Styles: Modify CSS properties of elements.
Add/Remove Elements: Dynamically add or delete elements.
Handle Events: Respond to user actions like clicks or typing.


3. Live Updates
The DOM is a live structure, meaning changes to the DOM (via JavaScript) immediately reflect on the webpage.


4. DOM vs HTML
    HTML: The static code written in the .html file.
    DOM: The dynamic in-memory representation of the HTML document, which the browser uses to render and interact with the page. -->



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1 id="title">Welcome To DOM</h1>
    <button onclick="changeTitle()">Click Me</button>

    <script>
      function changeTitle() {
        // Select the element
        const titleElement = document.getElementById('title');
        // Modify its content
        titleElement.textContent = 'Hello, DOM!';
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
